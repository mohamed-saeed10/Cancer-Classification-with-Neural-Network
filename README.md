# Cancer-Classification-with-Neural-Network
This project classifies breast cancer using a neural network with the sklearn breast cancer dataset. After conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand data patterns, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is built and trained. The model is then tested to evaluate its accuracy and effectiveness in predicting breast cancer.
